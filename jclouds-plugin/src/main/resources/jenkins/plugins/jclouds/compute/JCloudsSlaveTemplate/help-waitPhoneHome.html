    If enabled, the first SSH connection to the slave is delayed until the guest executes a POST to <pre>http://your.jenkins.url/jclouds-phonehome/</pre> providing it's hostname. In order to use this feature, you can enable the phone_home feature of cloud-init. See <a href="https://github.com/number5/cloud-init/blob/master/doc/examples/cloud-config-phone-home.txt" target="_blank">cloud-init Documentation</a>.
