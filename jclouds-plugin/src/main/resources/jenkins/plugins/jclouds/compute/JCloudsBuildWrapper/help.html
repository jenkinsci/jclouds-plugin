<div>
    Supplemental instances are JClouds instances that are temporarily provisioned for the lifetime of this job.
    Apart from being provisioned and torn down by the JClouds plugin, these instances are <b>not</b> under any
    control of jenkins. In particular, they do not contribute build slaves. They <i>are</i> however subject to
    the instance cap limitation of the specified JClouds profile.
    The IP addresses of the instances will be recorded in a comma-separated list, in the environment variable
    "JCLOUDS_IPS".
    How these instances are used is at the discretion of the build job.
    <h3>Blocking behavior</h3>
    If a template with active phone home-flag is specified, the the build will be blocked until the instance(s) have
    invoked the phone-home webhook (or the phone-home timeout has been reached). Otherwise, the build will commence
    immediately after launching the instances.
