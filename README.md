# JClouds Plugin for Jenkins

JClouds Jenkins plugin provides option to launch jenkins slaves on any Cloud provider supported by JClouds (http://www.jclouds.org/documentation/reference/supported-providers). 

### Configuration Options

You can add a new Cloud in the Jenkins configuration. The plugin requires the cloud provider type (as per JClouds Compute API provider list), access id and secret key. You can generate a keypair that will be used to connect and configure the slave.

The list of providers is an auto-complete field. There's an option to test the connection settings, which will validate your credentials. A new node can be launched via Jenkin's computer list (build executors) screen. 

We are working on more configuration options to configure auto-provisioning  and limits etc. 

## Building and Running

You can build and test this plugin using by cloning this repository and 

`mvn clean install hpi:run`

The above command will start jenkins with JClouds plugin pre-configured.

## Adding a new Cloud Provider

* Goto Jenkins Configuration page by clicking on Manage menu or browsing to the URL http://localhost:8080/configure
* Scroll down to Cloud Section
* Click on the `Add a new cloud` pop-up menu button which should have an option - `Cloud (JClouds)`
* Click on `Cloud (JClouds)`
* Fill in the configuration options
  - Profile : the name of the profile e.g, aws-slave-profile
  - Provider Name: type first two characters and you'll get an auto-completed provider name (e.g. aws-ec2 or hpcloud-compute)
  - End Point URL: if your provider API needs an endpoint configuration, add it here, otherwise leave it empty.
  - Identity : your accessId
  - Credential: your secret key
  - RSA Private Key/Public Key: If you have a keypair, then just copy paste the public and private key parts, otherwise click on `Generate Key Pair` button.
  - Click on `Test Connection` to validate the cloud settings.
  
* Add Cloud Instance Template by clicking on the Add button
* Fill in configuration options:
  - Name : the name of the instance template e.g. aws-jenkins-slave
  - Number of Executors: How many executors each slave created from this template should have.
  - Description: notes/comments for your reference.
  
  - Image ID: Image ID to use for this slave template, such as EC2 AMIs. Note that EC2 AMIs must include the region as well, e.g., "us-east-1/ami-00000".
  or
  - OSFamily: Specify the OSFamily - leave empty for default for a cloud provider
  - OS Version : Specify the OSVersion - leave empty for default for a cloud provider

  - Hardware ID: Hardware ID on provider for this slave template, such as "t1.micro" on AWS EC2.
  or
  - RAM : in MB
  - No. of Cores: number of virtual processor cores.

  - Labels: (space-separated) labels/tags that you can use to attach a build to this slave template
  - Init Script: A shell script to be run when the slave is created.
  - Stop on Terminate: If true, suspend slaves rather than terminating them.

* Click Save to save the configuration changes.
* Goto Jenkins' home page, click on `Build Executor Status` link on the sidebar.
* Verify that you have a button with `Provision via JClouds - {YOUR PROFILE NAME} drop down with the slave template name you configured.
* Click on the slave and see if your slave launched succesfully (please wait until the operation completes).

### Executing build on the slave
* To run your build on the newly configured slave computer, just enable the `Restrict where this project can be run` option in the build configuration page.
* Enter the label which you choose for the instance template in the `Label Expression` text field. This should auto-complete labels for you.
* Click save the save the configuration options.
* Schedule the build to check whether the build is executed on the selected slave template.


## Adding a Blobstore Profile for storing build artifacts

The plugin also provides a way to store your build artifacts on JClouds supported cloud storage providers. You can configure multiple
blobstore profiles and configure the build to copy different files/artifacts to the specified container. Here's how you configure the same.

* Goto Jenkins Configuration Page
* Click Ad under the section `JClouds Cloud Storage Settings`
* Provide the configuration Options:
  - Profile Name: name of the profile e.g. aws-storage
  - Provider Name: [JClouds Supported Provider Name](http://www.jclouds.org/documentation/userguide/blobstore-guide)
  - Identity : your accessId
  - Credential: your secret key
* You can add multiple providers by clicking on Add.
* Click Save on the bottom of the page, to save the settings.

### Publishing artifacts after a build
After you configure a cloudstorage provider, you can enable the publishing file by enabling it under `Post-build Actions` in the build job configuration page.
* Click on the checkbox `Publish artifacts to JClouds Clouds Storage`
* You should now see a dropdown with configured storage profiles. Select the one you want to use for this build.
* Click on Add button next to `Files to upload`.
* Add the sourcd file path (relative to workspace) 
* Add the destination container name.
* Repeat to add more files if you want to copy.
* Click save.

When the build is complete and succesful, the configured files will be published to the configured blobstore.
